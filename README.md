# Hoang Vinh Nguyen 

**`Tech Student`**

Currently studying for a bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology at the
Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. I enjoy working both in teams and
independently and find it easy to collaborate with others. I am motivated to use
the knowledge I have gained through my studies to gain relevant work
experience.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy backpacking, running, and exploring mountains and
nature. When I relax, I love playing cards with friends and family.
